Some Types of Exceptions in PHP: 

    -[Exception]: 
        The base class for all exceptions. 

    -[LogicException]:

        This is the base class for exceptions that represent programming logic errors.
    
    -[RuntimeException]:
        Represents errors that can only be found on runtime.
        This is the base class for exceptions that occur during the program execution.
    
    -[ErrorException]: 
        Used to convert PHP errors into exceptions.

    -[OutOfBoundsException]:
        Thrown when an illegal index was requested.
        This represents errors that should be detected at compile time.
